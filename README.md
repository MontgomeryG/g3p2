# Stock Breakout Strategy and Machine Learning Model Repository
Group 3 Project 2
## Overview
This repository is dedicated to implementing and exploring a stock breakout strategy for predicting optimal entry and exit points in financial markets. The project aims to leverage historical price data to develop a robust trading algorithm and deploy it to autonomously execute buy and sell orders.

## Key Features

1. **Breakout Strategy Implementation:**
- Code for a basic breakout strategy that identifies potential breakout signals based on historicalprice movements.

2. **Supervised Machine Learning Model:**
- Implementation of a supervised machine learning model trained on historical data to enhance the accuracy of predicting breakout points.
3. **Data Preparation and Analysis:**
- Tools for preprocessing and analyzing historical stock price data to feed into the breakout strategy and machine learning model.

4. **Automated Trading Algorithm:**
- Development of an algorithm for automated trading, allowing the code to autonomously execute buy and sell orders based on the predicted breakout signals.

5. **Documentation and Instructions:**
- Comprehensive documentation providing clear instructions on how to use the code, customize parameters, and interpret results.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone git@github.com:MontgomeryG/g3p2.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Explore Breakout Strategy:**
- Navigate to the breakout strategy directory and run the example code to understand the basic breakout strategy implementation.

4. **Train Machine Learning Model:**
- Use provided scripts to train a supervised machine learning model on historical data and evaluate its performance.

5. **Deploy Automated Trading Algorithm:**
- Integrate the breakout strategy and machine learning model into an automated trading algorithm. Follow deployment instructions to execute buy and sell orders
