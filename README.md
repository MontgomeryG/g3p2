# Stock Breakout Strategy and Machine Learning Model Repository
Group 3 Project 2
## Overview
This repository is dedicated to implementing and exploring a stock breakout strategy for predicting optimal entry and exit points in financial markets. The project aims to leverage historical price data to develop a robust trading algorithm and deploy it to autonomously execute buy and sell orders.

## Key Features

1. **Breakout Strategy Implementation:**
- Code for a basic breakout strategy that identifies potential breakout signals based on historicalprice movements.

2. **Supervised Machine Learning Model:**
- Implementation of a supervised machine learning model trained on historical data to enhance the accuracy of predicting breakout points.
3. **Data Preparation and Analysis:**
- Tools for preprocessing and analyzing historical stock price data to feed into the breakout strategy and machine learning model.

4. **Automated Trading Algorithm:**
- Development of an algorithm for automated trading, allowing the code to autonomously execute buy and sell orders based on the predicted breakout signals.

5. **Documentation and Instructions:**
 Comprehensive documentation providing clear instructions on how to use the code, customize parameters, and interpret results.
